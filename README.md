# DataExtractingFromSkillshare
A task from skillshare

How to run?
open this folder on the console then type npm start 
Now, goto your browser 127.0.0.1:3000/extract
Then put skillshare's links for an example https://www.skillshare.com/everytuesday/teaching 
It'll pull out some data from the page like Channel name, follower, courses and no of students!

I have used express (a node.js framework) to perform this task.
